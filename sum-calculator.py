# Write a program that will ask for 2 numbers (integer or float) and calculate the sum of those two numbers.
# define the two variables
number1 = int(input("enter a number\t"))
number2 = float(input("enter another number\t"))

#combine the 2 variables
sum = number1 + number2

# print the result
print ("The sum of number1 and number2 is: ", sum)
